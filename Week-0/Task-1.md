## üèó Overview of Design Stages (O0 to O4)

This section explains the progression of a VLSI/SoC design project from the **initial C model** to the **final GDSII layout**. Each stage has its own objectives, methodologies, and verification steps.

---

### **O0 ‚Äì High-Level C Model**
**Objective:** Validate algorithm functionality before hardware implementation.  

- Initial design created using **C language** and compiled with **GCC**.  
- A simple **C testbench** is developed to verify functionality.  
- Focus is on **algorithm correctness**, not hardware efficiency.  

**Theory / Notes:**  
- Helps catch logical errors early.  
- Simplifies simulation since C models execute faster than RTL.  

---

### **O1 ‚Äì Specification**
**Objective:** Define functional and architectural specifications.  

- Complete specification is documented: **inputs, outputs, timing, and architecture**.  
- Testing still performed in **C environment**.  
- Design constraints and expected behavior are clarified.  

**Theory / Notes:**  
- Serves as a bridge between conceptual design and RTL implementation.  
- Critical for ensuring hardware matches intended functionality.  



---

### **O2 ‚Äì RTL Development**
**Objective:** Convert specifications into synthesizable **Verilog RTL**.  

- Components designed:
  - **Processor Core**
  - **Peripherals and IPs**
  - **Analog IP models** (for mixed-signal integration)  
- Verification performed using **testbench derived from O1**.  

**Theory / Notes:**  
- RTL (Register Transfer Level) is a hardware description that can be synthesized.  
- Ensures that the architecture is implementable in hardware.  
- Important concepts: pipelining, FSMs, module hierarchy, signal timing.  



---

### **O3 ‚Äì Synthesis and SoC Integration**
**Objective:** Convert RTL to **Gate-Level Netlist** and integrate SoC components.  

- **Synthesis Tools:** Generate gate-level representation from RTL.  
- **Integration Steps:**
  - Floorplanning
  - Placement
  - Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
  - Routing
  - Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) verification  

**Theory / Notes:**  
- Ensures that the design can be physically realized on silicon.  
- Timing closure, area optimization, and power analysis are performed.  


---

### **O4 ‚Äì Final GDSII and Fabrication**
**Objective:** Produce the final **GDSII file** for fabrication.  

- Export GDSII layout ready for tape-out.  
- Typical applications:  
  - Smartwatches  
  - Arduino boards  
  - TV panels  
  - AC controllers  
- Target operating frequency: **100 MHz ‚Äì 130 MHz**.  

**Theory / Notes:**  
- GDSII is the standard file format used for **IC fabrication**.  
- Fabrication includes photolithography, etching, deposition, and testing.  
- Verification at this stage ensures DRC/LVS compliance and manufacturability.

### **Summary**
- The flow from **O0 ‚Üí O4** represents the complete VLSI/SoC design cycle.  
- Early validation in C (O0‚ÄìO1) saves time and reduces errors in hardware.  
- RTL design (O2) bridges the algorithm and physical implementation.  
- Synthesis and integration (O3) ensures the design meets timing, area, and functional requirements.  
- GDSII (O4) finalizes the design for real-world fabrication.
